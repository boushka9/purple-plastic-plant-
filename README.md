# JavaScript Quiz
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


## Installation

No Installation is necessary to use this application. The deployed page can be accessed at https://boushka9.github.io/tiny-lego-parakeet/ .


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits
