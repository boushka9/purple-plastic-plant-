## <img src="./assets/images/about.png" alt="About Header" height="40px">
The purpose of this project was to create a basic quiz using JavaScript to render the quiz questions and answer choices on the screen and recording the users answers as the quiz progresses. The quiz includes a timer functionality, feedback on answer choices, and a save high score option as well as a page to view and compare past saved high scores. The most difficult aspects of this project for me were the functions to randomly display questions without having repeat questions, and the functions to judge if the question the user selected were correct or incorrect. Both of these functionalities were achieved using arrow function expressions, and the .forEach() method, which executes a function for each element in an array. Both of these were foreign concepts for me at the beginning of this project that I learned to create this project.

1. As the instructions on the homepage state, there are ten coding related questions to be completed in under 120 seconds. Each correct question is worth ten points towards your score, while each incorrect question will deduct 10 seconds from the timer. Press the start button to begin the quiz.


2. Once you press start, the timer will begin counting down, and you will see a question along with four answer options appear on the screen.

    - If you answer the question correctly, a light blue 'Correct!' will appear beneath the questions. If your answer is incorrect, a red 'Wrong!' will appear instead.

    - If you answer all the questions before the timer runs out, you will see the 'Congrats!' page. If the timer reaches zero before you finish answering all of the questions, you will see the 'Uh-Oh!' page.

3. Both end pages will give you the option of saving your initials and score, and/or returning to the homepage to try the quiz over again.

5. Once you have played a couple of rounds and saved your scores, check out the list of saved high scores. To do so, click on the link at the top left corner of the screen. This will take you to the high scores page which will list out a ranking of the scores from highest to lowest. To return to the homepage, press 'Go Back' at the top left corner of the screen.
